## Configuring custom Substrate providers / chains

In the `.env` file at root project directory, you have to define the following env variables:

```
REACT_APP_SUBSTRATE_PROVIDER_1=<WS-Provider chain 1>
REACT_APP_SUBSTRATE_PROVIDER_2=<WS-Provider chain 2>
REACT_APP_PROVIDER_NAME_1=<Chain 1 name>
REACT_APP_PROVIDER_NAME_2=<Chain 2 name>
```

| ‚ÑπÔ∏è | In case these values are not provided the default chains will be Rialto and Millau chains. |
